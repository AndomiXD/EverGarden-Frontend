### Out First MERN-Stack Project

EverGarden is a MERN-stack website that allows users to grow their own garden. Users can purchase seeds, plant them, and harvest them after a period of time to sell them, then use the extra cash to purchase more expensive seeds to earn even bigger rewards. Users can also share their progress to each other, adding a layer of socialising.
